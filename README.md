# New Carboncoin

The site is a static served using Netlify.

It uses Bootstrap 4 for layout.

The ICO section of the site is a simple React app that loads the ICO contract details from [Carboncoin ICO Backend](https://gitub.com/carboncoinfoundation/ico-backend) if a user has accepted the terms and conditions.

### Making changes

To make changes, create a new branch (based off master) using the dropdown menu on the repository homepage. Call it 'your-name/what-you-are-updating'.

Make your changes and commit them into your branch.

Once you are finished, create a pull request into the master branch. All Pull Requests need to be reviewed! Deployments to Netlify are not automatic.
